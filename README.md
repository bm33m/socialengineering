Izinkinga zomhlaba azipheli, bonke abantu banezinkinga zabo. Uxazulula le kuvele enye futhi. Social engineering's effort is to try and solve common well known problems facing society. Sometimes when you solve some problems other complex problems pop up in a process.

Looking at the world from the linguistic point of view, multilingual skills could come handy. Take for example algorithm, algebra, what language is that? Everybody who understands mathematics knows what algebra is, but very few people know that it was derived from the Arabic text sound.
It is like listening to the nice song that you like in a new language. The words make nice sound that you like but can't make sense of it, the first time you listen to it. Eventually once you understand
the new language the words would make more sense. Mathematics and Computer Science are full  of mixed words that are derived from multiple languages.

Mathematics is an exact science. Computer Science uses a lot of mathematics. Change is inevitable
except for the vending machine. Other schools of thought like Accounting also uses a lot of mathematics. Other systems like financial systems uses accounting. Most new accounting systems uses computer science. Accounting uses accounting standards. Accounting standards changes all the
time.

In this episode we shall be using a lot of AI models and abstract models derived from various schools of thought, both old schools and new schools. New schools are derived from old schools, they don't just start from scratch. To simplify things we shall also create some DIY abstract user case models, some DIY models, some case models and some frameworks.

To make things easier instead of harder we shall start with the abstract case study model based on a fictional city of gold called Esithilami. Esithilami is a world within the city in a fictional country called Nemalendi. When you take a snapshot of the city, different people could look at the same snapshot in manny different angles based on their experience about life, expectations, ambitions, priorities and needs. People come and go at Esithilami. Some stay a little bit longer, some stay only for a very short time. The Esithilami snapshots are always changing from time to time.

City lifespan is very long compared to human lifespan, which is very short. Nobody really knows
how old is Esithilami. Historians as far as they are concerned will only tell you what they know based on what they have read about or heard about.

The discovery of gold in Esithilami atracted many people from far and near, searching for greener  
pastures. Gold rush was the order of the day. Some people became rich instantly. Some others were
injured due to dangerous gold mining activities and became crippled, some others deaf, some other
blind.

Gold wasn't the only precious metal discovered in Esithilami. Various other precious metals and scarce minerals were discovered in Esithilami and surrounding areas. Several phenomena similar
to gold rush were repeated with other mining activities. Why should the same predicament repeat itself? Using mathematics induction models, mathematicians can predict the probability of the samething to happen over and over again. The opposite is also true. One can use induction models to stop
the same quandary to repeat itself. Other scientists could say, wait a minute, that is not how induction works! Human beings use common sense to prevent an accident. On the other hand machines don't have common sense. Programmers create some ML modules derived from induction
to help the machines to be able to make logical decisions.

Gold and other precious metals don't grow on trees. Eventually some mines ran out of gold and were closed down. This had a ripple affect on some other economics that were depended on gold products e.g. gold coins. Old school used gold coins. People were carrying gold coins doing business with gold coins. Everybody likes change. The old school mastered the principle of change.
If you go to the shop to buy something that cost 97 cents and you pay with a coin that is worth 100 cents, you would expert a change of:
(a) 97 cents.
(b) 100 cents.
(c) 95 cents.
(d) 90 cents.
(e) 5 cents.
(f) 3 cents.
(g) 10 cents.
(h) 197 cents.
(i) No change.
(j) None of the above.
Choose the correct answer. It's obvious, the change you will get will depend on the business you are
dealing with. Good reasoning and bad reasoning are both possible. How can you tell if you are dealing with a bad or good business? There is a thin line between the the bad and good business. Since mathematics is an exact science, there is no room for ambiguity. The mathematical answer can be either correct or incorrect. You can get a correct change or incorrect  change or no change.

With small numbers it is easy to test the system and correct the error if any. With big numbers things get little bit complicated.
If you buy 21 items that cost 953 cents and pay with a coin that is worth 50000 cents, how much change would you expect?
(a) No change.
(b) 29000 cents.
(c) 21000 cents.
(d) 21953 cents.
(e) 29953 cents.
(f) 30000 cents.
(g) 29980 cents.
(h) 29987 cents.
(i) 29990 cents.
(j) 29985 cents.
(k) None of the above.
Choose the correct answer.

Some businesses in Esithilami were struggling with change.  They were so used to gold coins. Suddenly there was a shortage of some gold coins denominations. The shortage of change presented a dilemma. After all, what should businesses do if there is a shortage of some gold coins denominations?  Life must continue. Virtual coins in a form of crypto currencies came to rescue.

Some other tasks are too complex and time consuming for a one man's show. To that end, Esithilami
recherche et developpement bonne foi société was established to solve complex social engineering issues. The corner stone of Esithilami recherche et developpement bonne foi société (EREDBFS) is faith based on religious principles. The premise is that for God loved the world, so he sent his son to save it. If you believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God then you shall be saved.

So what's happening here is that in software engineering you build micro modules and you test them and fix bugs if any. Eventually you combine them with other micro modules to form a macro system.

One may ask, why build so many micro modules if you want to solve one problem? Of course you can use one module to solve one problem, depending on what type of problem you are trying to solve. Some problems are more complex than others, some are easy to solve, some are not. The
levels of complexity or complication depends on the solutions provider's point of view, bias, agenda, goals, experience, skills, priorities, analysis, resources, etc. Take for an example, if you want to build an AI ML device system that can help people with physical disabilities, i.e.  Blind, deaf, crippled, dumb, etc. Blind could be sightless or vision impaired or partially sighted, depending
on the degree of the condition. Deaf, could be hard of hearing, without hearing, etc. Crippled, could
be disabled, handicapped, paralysed, lame, incapacitated, etc. Dumb, could be unable to speak, mute, soundless, etc. Different people could have different needs, some could have common needs.  
You could use some micro modules on different projects.  

Another one could also ask, why do you use abstract modules for AI ML models? Why don't you use concrete models from specific school concerning the subject matter? Of course again you can use knowledge gained from specialised schools, if you want to, e.g. Theology, Science, Arts, Business, Engineering, etc. Most of the time the information you want could be scatted all over the place. The complexity of the system could grow as you  try to make it user friendly. Abstraction can
help to solve the complexity paradox by managing the inevitable of a very large software system.
Different programming languages uses different terminologies for the same thing, e.g. template,
abstract data types, abstract class, virtual class, etc. Sometimes two different programming languages can use the same name to mean two different thing, e.g. template. One programming language can mean a plan that can be implemented by other classes. In another programming language it can mean a generic class that can be used by various data types.

From the distance it might look like natural languages are trying to complicate things. Each and every natural language have it's own phonétique, syntax rules, rules on how to use it. If you think that is complicated wait until you do cryptography. On the other hand abstract models are trying to
simplify complicated things. Once you have simplified the problem you can solve it easily and hit the road running. Some abstract models can be trivial.

One may ask what's the difference between faith and knowledge?
People use faith to create credence.
Machines use knowledge to create artificial intelligence.

A multilingual AI agent can ask, what's the difference between 1 cent and 1 per cent, 100 cents et 100 pour cent?
The answer can depend on which language you are using, as well as the context. A cent can mean a hundred when translated from knowledgeBeseB2[2] to knowledgeBeseB3[3] language. It can also mean a currency, a coin, change, monnaie, monnaie unique, single currency, nombre, inombolo, ikhulu, okwekhulu, 1/100, 100/100, cent pour cent, hundred per cent.

The ML agent can ask again, what about 1 centimeter and 100 centimeters?


This AI agent talks a lot, we might as well build an AI chatbot. From the new school, at some stage the AI ML agent should able to learn by itself, using deep learning. All you have to do is build some
ML modules and some ML knowledgeBeses and the ML AI agent shall do the rest.

The new school simplifies things a lot. The question still stands about 1 centimeter and 100 centimeters or centimetre depending on which side of river or ocean you are at. Since we building a
multipurpose ML AI agent device, we might as well help the curious AI agent. By itself, a computer
will not do anything useful. It needs a program. A sequence of instructions that tells it what to d. To
that end, programming languages e.g. machine language, strategies and terminologies e.g. machine
learning, deep learning do just that.  Other things are too obvious for human beings. On the other hand when you are developing an AI device, you have to state the obvious. If you leave out the obvious, don't be surprised when the AI device has started acting. So the ML AI agent can now talk before it can run. How curious, par simple curiosité.

Abstract runner model:

```

class AbstractRunnerModel():
    def __init__(self, runner):
        self.speed = runner.speed
        self.direction = runner.direction
        self.isMoving = runner.isMoving
        self.model = runner.model
        self.name = runner.name

    def run(self, runner):
        pass

    def stop(self, runner):
        pass

```


Excellent! Now the ML AI agent can now run. Grab a snack or something. One more thing, the ML
AI agent still needs a vision system. No problem, we shall build one just now.        

Abstract vision model.

```
class AbstractVisionModel():
    def __init__(self, vision):
        self.name = vision.name
        self.model = vision.model
        self.position = vision.position
        self.range = vision.range

    def view(self, vision):
        pass

    def scene(self, vision):
         pass


```


Can you believe it? Now the AI agent can see using the computer vision system.

## Episode 24.
## Épisode vingt quatre.

In the previous episode the curious character, AI agent asked what languege is algebra, algorithm.
This AI agent is quite a character! If someone said, Kitab al jabr w'al-muqabal. What would you say? Of course your respond would depend on your comprehension of the words and the language in question. If you are creative and you don't have a clue what this scholar is talking about, you might as well add some new words in your vocabulary list. Building a vocabulary list is not a bad thing, it is an open secret on how to learn a new language. To that end, the curious AI agent character do just that. It builds it's own vocabulary list using the knowledge base system. Interestingly, the scholar who wrote Kitab al jabr w'al-muqabala, his name was Abu Ja'far Muhammed iba Mȗsȃ al-Khowȗrȋzmi. From this text agebra (al jabr) and algorithm (ai-Khowȗrȋzmi) was derived. The curious AI agent character can ask again, what about Moses?

This AI agent character ask a lot of questions just like a child. Of course it uses baby model. If kids don't ask questions how would they learn? Baby model uses a natural way to learn new things. Natural languages are some of the complex things in this world. No body knows all the natural languages in this world. If you are a fast learner and can master one language within a year, it could take 100 years to master 100 languages! If someone say Musa or Mûsâ, how would the words sound like? Someone could say Mosi other one could say Moses. Interestingly Musa and Mûsâ are
two different words from two diffeent languages. The first one means grace. e.g. Abantu basindiswa
ngomusa ka Nkulunkulu. One can also derive a name from umusa to Musa or Nomusa, from grace
to Grace. The story about Moses (Mûsâ, Mosi) is well documented in the Bible. The one found in the river. Moses just couldn't escape Pharaoh. When Pharaoh was eliminating baby boys, Moses's parents tried to hide him in the river, but Pharaoh's daughter found him. Eventually Moses grew up
in the household of Pharaoh. For political reasons Moses tried again to run away from Pharaoh, but God found him and send back to Pharaoh for other very important mission.

The AI agent character could ask, is there a link between Moses's experience and Jesus Christ experience? The story about Jesus Christ is also well documented in the Bible. God send Jesus Christ on earth for a very important mission. Izazi zasempumalanga zabuza ku Herodi ukuthi iNkosi etsha izalelwe kuphi na? U Herodi wamangala ukuthi ngubani le Nkosana ezombangisa   
ebukhosini bakhe. Uma uHerodi eseqala ukubulala abantwana abancane abasanda kuzalwa, uJesu
wabaleka waya kude. Uma isikhathi sesilungile uJesu waphinda wabuya. Waqala ukwenza umsebenzi we Vangeli, wenza izimangaliso esindisa abantu. Waqala neBandla lakhe.
